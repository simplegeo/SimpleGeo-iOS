# SimpleGeo on iOS

**This is SimpleGeo's sample iOS application.**

This app demonstrates how to integrate [`SimpleGeo.framework`](https://github.com/simplegeo/simplegeo.framework) into an iOS project. The app uses the framework to make API requests to SimpleGeo [Context,](https://simplegeo.com/products/context/) [Places,](https://simplegeo.com/products/places/) and [Storage.](https://simplegeo.com/products/storage/)

[`SimpleGeo-iOS`] uses MapKit to show SimpleGeo Places and SimpleGeo Storage Records on a map. The app allows you to view SimpleGeo Context, browse and search SimpleGeo Places, and explore a SimpleGeo Storage layer from your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch.

## Getting Started

1. Download [`SimpleGeo.framework`](https://github.com/simplegeo/simplegeo.framework) and drag it into the Resources/ subdirectory.

2. Rename `Resources/Credentials_template.h` to `Credentials.h` and provide your SimpleGeo OAuth key and secret.

3. Start coding!
